 * A proxy controller to be registered with a ModelController.

 * Proxy controllers apply to a given address in the host ModelController
 * and typically allow access to an external ModelController.

 * For example if a ProxyController is registered in the host ModelController for the address
 * <code>[a=b,c=d]</code>, then an operation executed in the host ModelController for
 * <code>[a=b]</code> will execute in the host model controller as normal. An operation for
 * <code>[a=b,c=d,x=y]</code> will apply to <code>[x=y]</code> in the model controller
 * pointed to by this proxy controller.
